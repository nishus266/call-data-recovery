        Call Data Recovery has developed new technology to recover data from Android Devices, which includes software and hardware tools based on newest generation of our in-house built PCI-e Zcopy Ultra board. This board also support SSDs, SD and MMC cards, monolithic flash memory devices. We are able to recover data from Android devices whether they have logical corruption or physical damage. Our engineers have successfully recovered data from virtually every type and brand of Android-based devices produced, such as smartphones and tablets, laptops, netbooks or smartbooks. In addition, the Android operating system has been used on cameras, smart glasses, smartwatches, headphones, cars and portable media players.
   </br></br>
   All these portable devices take a lot of abuse, and with today's mobile technology, more and more critical data is being stored on Android-based appliances every day. Because Android smart phones and tablets are carried about and exposed to different environmental factors such as water and heat, or accidental drops, those gadgets are far more susceptible to data loss and became a subject for data recovery. Their portability makes these sophisticated and essential Android mobile devices prime candidates for data loss. At the same time, as an increasing amount of data is being stored on them, these devices are still the least frequently backed-up. Even if your device is completely broken, soaked in liquids or melted - give Call Data Recovery a chance to extract your data.

All information on Android-based devices is stored on the flash media, regardless if it is internal memory or additional SD cards. Call Data Recovery has developed an advanced flash recovery technology that consists of reading individual flash memory chips into raw images, then applying reverse-engineered error correction and special mapping algorithms to unscramble each image and assembling them. The resulting image can then be processed using existing data recovery methods.

We support smartphone and tablet devices with Android OS 2.1 and later from Samsung, HTC, LG, Sony, Motorola, and others
