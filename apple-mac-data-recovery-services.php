    It's not enough to just recover your data from your Mac. As you probably know, all Apple devices save photos and videos into fully categorized and highly organized libraries which makes browsing and retrieval easy for the user. These libraries depend on a complicated linkage system that we know how to preserve in their entireties. Imagine if you accidently dropped an expensive glass serving bowl you received as a wedding present and shattered it across the floor. Yes, you could collect all of the individual glass shards, but what do you do all of those pieces? At Call Data Recovery, we don't just recover your individual treasured photos and videos and return them to you in one big unorganized cluster. Unlike the services of our competitors, our data recovery process involves the total retrieval of your library fully intact, not just the individual files.

    Similarly, Macs also utilize a built-in backup software solution called Time Machine that breaks up your backups into a complicated puzzle. At Call Data Recovery we know how to rescue and reassemble this puzzle as well. Please note that drives that have become non-functional through normal use, and have had data recovery performed on them by Call Data Recovery can be returned to Apple for warranty service. Our "No data - No charge" policy guarantees that our clients pay only for successful data recovery cases, i.e. when critical data from their Mac is recovered. However, the cost of data recovery service done by any data recovery company won't be covered by the Apple Limited Warranty.
